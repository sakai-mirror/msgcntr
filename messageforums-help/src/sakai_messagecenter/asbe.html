<h2>Viewing Discussion Forums</h2>




 

<p>To see the list of Discussion Forums for your site, click
<strong><code>Message Center</code></strong> in your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>. On the
Message Center screen, the Private Message Area is always on top, and
the Discussion Forums area is on the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Discussion Forums area does not contain
default forums. No forums will appear here until the site creator (or
someone with an appropriate role) creates them.</p>

<p>Forums are listed with their titles and short descriptions (if
created) displayed. Beneath the forum title, topics are listed by
title, and include a short description (if created). A count of
messages (total and unread) is shown for each topic.  If a topic has
an attachment, its filename and size will be displayed. Click the
filename to open the attachment, or save it to your computer.</p>


<p>Clicking the name of any forum will open the Forum Detail view,
which is an isolated view of a particular forum and its
topics. Clicking the title of any topic will display all messages for
that particular topic. If a full description of the topic exists
(i.e., if the topic's author added the description in the Topic
Settings screen), click <strong><code>Read Full Description</code></strong> to view it.</p><p /><p>Depending on how the forum settings are configured, and your role
within the site, the following options may be available:</p>

<ul><li><strong><code>New Forum</code></strong> opens the Discussion Forum Settings screen for
creating a new forum. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=asci">Creating a new forum and topic in Discussion Forums</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>New Topic</code></strong> opens the Topic Settings screen for creating a
new topic. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=asci">Creating a new forum and topic in Discussion Forums</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Forum Settings</code></strong> opens the Discussion Forum Settings screen
for revising an existing forum. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atdk">Revising or deleting a forum or topic</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Topic Settings</code></strong> opens the Topic Settings screen for
revising an existing topic. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atdk">Revising or deleting a forum or topic</a>.<br /><br />

screen. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atdk">Revising or deleting a forum or topic</a>.
