<h2>Message Center: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>



<p>The Message Center is a communication tool that instructors or site
leaders can use to create an unlimited number of discussion forums for
their course or project sites. The Private Messages area allows site
participants to communicate using internal course mail. Private
messaging between groups is also supported. The Message Center is
designed to be an effective tool for both academic and collaborative
work, and is integrated closely with other tools (e.g., Resources and
Gradebook).</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Private messages:</strong> Individuals and groups can send
internal mail to each other. This function can be deactivated.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing messages:</strong> Unread messages are in bold;
viewed messages are permanently marked as read. By default, messages are
listed chronologically. Also, users can select Threaded view to display
messages in indented threads. The Unread Only view will show only those messages you have not read.</p>

<p><strong>Composing messages:</strong> A WYSIWYG interface
allows rich text, plain text, and HTML editing. You can add
attachments to any message by linking to files or web links in
Resources. By default, the original message is not included in a
reply, but a quote option is available that pastes the original text
into the message.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion forums:</strong> Asynchronous discussion
provides an opportunity for your site participants to engage site
resources and each other, and allows for the free expression of
convergent and divergent ideas. Interactions can be assigned a point
value and sent to the Gradebook.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing forums:</strong> On your site's Home page (select
<strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>), participants can see
how many unread private and discussion forum messages they have. On
the Message Center screen, participants see the number of unread
messages and the grand total of messages for each topic.  In the
forums list, forums and topics are sorted chronologically by
default.</p>

<p><strong>Settings:</strong> The site owner (or another participant
with the appropriate role) can require participants to submit their
posts to a topic before they have permission to read the responses of
others. Other settings provide control over access rights (i.e., which
individuals or groups can see forums and contribute) and permissions for creating forums, topics, messages, and responses.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>If private messaging is activated, a participant can send private
messages to another individual, a select number of individuals, or a
select number of groups.
