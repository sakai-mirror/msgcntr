<h2>Forums: Overview</h2>














<h3>What it does</h3>



<p>Forums is a communication tool that instructors or site leaders can
use to create an unlimited number of discussion forums for their
course or project sites. Forums is designed to be an effective tool
for both academic and collaborative work, and is integrated closely
with other tools (e.g., Resources and Gradebook).</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Discussion forums:</strong> Asynchronous discussion
provides an opportunity for your site participants to engage site
resources and each other, and allows for the free expression of
convergent and divergent ideas. Interactions can be assigned a point
value and sent to the Gradebook with comments.</p>

<p><strong>Viewing forums:</strong> On your site's Home page (select
<strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>), participants can see
how many unread discussion forum messages they have. On
the Forums screen, participants see the number of unread
messages and the grand total of messages for each topic.  In the
forums list, forums and topics are viewed as a thread by
default.</p>

<p><strong>Composing messages:</strong> A WYSIWYG interface
allows rich text, plain text, and HTML editing. You can add
attachments to any message by linking to files or web links in
Resources.
</p><p><strong>Quoted text:</strong> Use the <strong><code>Insert Original Text</code></strong>
option to insert the previous post into your response.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics:</strong> Forum statistics are available for
site owners to determine the participation level of individual
participants.</p>

<p><strong>Print-friendly view:</strong> A print-friendly view is
available allowing for easy printing of discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Import forums and topics:</strong> Re-use materials easily
by importing forums and topics from your other sites.</p>

<p><strong>Settings:</strong> The site owner (or another participant
with the appropriate role) can enable participants to submit their
posts to a topic before they have permission to read the responses of
others.</p>

<p><strong>Group awareness:</strong> Site leaders can change forum and
topic settings in combination with pre-defined groups to allow or deny
access to specific discussions per group.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>A forum is not visible to site participants unless at least one
topic is created.
