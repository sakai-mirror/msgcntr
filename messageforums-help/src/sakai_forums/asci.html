<h3>Creating a forum</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>There are no default forums or topics in the Forums tool. No forums
will appear in this area until someone with an appropriate role
creates them. By default, participants (e.g., students) in a course
site cannot create forums.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you create your forum, you'll need to
add at least one topic so site participants can post messages. The
forum will not be visible to participants unless a topic is added.</p>

<p>To create a new forum:</p>

description (limited to 100 characters) that will be displayed along
with the title in the Forums area. <br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Description" field, you may enter an in-depth description
of your forum, and provide any associated information or
resources.<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the URL for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>To disable forum postings, under "Forum Posting", click the
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> radio button next to "Lock Topic (Disable forum

</li><li>To moderate forum postings, under "Forum Posting", click the
