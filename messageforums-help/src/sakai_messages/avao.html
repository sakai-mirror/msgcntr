<h2>Messages: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Messages tool is a communication tool that allows site
participants to communicate using internal course mail. Private
messaging between groups is also supported.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Viewing messages:</strong> Unread messages are in bold;
viewed messages are permanently marked as read. By default, messages are
listed chronologically. Also, users can select By Conversation view to display
messages in indented threads.</p>

<p><strong>Composing messages:</strong> A WYSIWYG interface
allows rich text, plain text, and HTML editing. You can also add
attachments.</p>

<p><strong>Message priority:</strong> You can set priority levels for messages to distinguish important messages from others.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Using Messages, a participant can send private
messages to another individual, a select number of individuals, or a
select number of groups. 
</li><li>Messages that are sent with the "To Recipients' Email Address(es)" option will be sent directly to a participant's email address and will not be stored in the Messages area.
</li></ul>
