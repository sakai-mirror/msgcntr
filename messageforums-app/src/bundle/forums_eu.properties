forums=Provides a set of RESTful endpoints for retrieving single fora, site collections of fora \n, individual topics (collections of threads) and messages with their children. An example workflow \nwould be to call the site action with /direct/forums/site/SITEID.json for the top level fora in a \nsite, then to use /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID.json to get an individual forum to the topic level. \nAfter that you would use /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID/topic/TOPICID.json to get a topic, basically\na set of threads, then you would call /direct/forums/site/SITEID/forum/FORUMID/topic/TOPICID/message/MESSAGEID.json \nto get a fully populated message with attachments and children.
